# AES-CBC Padding Oracle Attack Simulator

!!!This project is intended for educational and research purposes only. Do not use it on systems without permission.

This repository demonstrates a simulation of the **AES-CBC padding oracle attack**, a well-known cryptographic vulnerability that exploits improper error handling in CBC mode encryption with padding.

## üîê What It Does

This simulator:
- Simulates a padding oracle by returning padding errors.
- Demonstrates how attackers can recover plaintext by manipulating ciphertext blocks and observing oracle responses.
